# WSJT-X 2.7.0 GA (modified)
 WSJT-X 2.7.0 GA ("general availability" as released February 17, 2025), modified for use with "Otto".
 <br><i>Note that WSJT-X 2.7.0 had an unusually large number of new features added (sourced from "WSJT-X Improved") for the GA release.
 <br>This modified version contains all of those features, in addition to the features added since RC4 ("release candidate").</i>
 <br><br>Download the installer from the release page: 
 <br>https://github.com/avantol/WSJT-X_2.7.0-GA/releases/latest
 <br><br>Download Otto.msi (required*) at https://github.com/avantol/WSJTX-Controller-v2
 <br><br>(These two programs must run at the same time, as a versioned pair)
 <br>Also make sure Trusted QSL ("TQSL") is installed, and in the suggested folder.
 <br><br>When running the installers, at the Windows warning message, click "More info" then "Run anyway".
 <br><br>* Required for all the Otto features, that is. If you run WSJT-X 2.7.0 GA without Otto, you can still use the one-click upload to / download from LOTW.
